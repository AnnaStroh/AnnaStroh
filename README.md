- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnnaStroh
- I am a PhD student at the Atlantic Technological University, Ireland. With my PhD project, I aim to improve the accuracy and precision
  of fisheries-independent survey-derived abundance indices using spatiotemporal modelling.
- 🌱 I learn and apply various (spatiotemporal) modelling tools, advanced data manipulation, and spatial operations. I always strive towards more efficient and universally reproducable coding.
- 🐟 I am fascinated by fisheries science, and my main research interests include quantitative fisheries management, population dynamics, and fisheries ecology.
